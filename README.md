In this project I discussed about two types of tumour 
1. Benign tumour 
-Non Cancerous
-Capsulated
-Slow growing
 2. Malignant tumour
-Cancerous
-Non Capsulated
- Fast Growing
And took the dataset from Kaggle and the workflow is
Dataset - Data Pre processing - Train Test Split - Logistic Regression Model
Trained Logistic Regression Model and after that you have to import some python libraries which will be used for cleaning, modifying and predicting the dataset.

import numpy
import Pandas
from sklearn.datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn .linear_model import Logistic Regression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

And after that you can see the code.
